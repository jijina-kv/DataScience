Dear Team,
    I am software developer with experience in developing and maintaining software applications, I am seeking to transition to a  data analyst/data scientist/BI developer role. I believe that my background in problem-solving and analytical thinking, combined with my deep understanding of data structures and algorithms, make me a strong candidate for this role.

I have recently completed a certification course on data science, machine learning, and algorithms from IIT madras. The course has provided me with a solid foundation in data visualization and analysis tools such as PowerBI, as well as experience with database management systems such as MySQL. I am also familiar with popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.


I would like to mention that I have taken a break from my carrier due to maternity leave, but I am eager to get back to work and make a change in my carrier. I am confident that this opportunity will provide me to showcase my ability in data analysis and mentorship I need to succeed in this field.
